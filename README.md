# galvanize-group-project-2

From inside the /Howard directory (trying to restructure but intelliJ throws a fit), run `docker-compose build` and then `docker-compose up`.

Unix users may need to run `chmod +x entrypoint.sh` from within the frontend directory.

The app will then be found at http://localhost for docker/docker desktop users or http://192.168.99.100 for docker toolbox users.
